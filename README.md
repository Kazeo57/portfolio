## About me
Just develop? No I'm more in research,continuous increasing,build AI system whatever ressources this is my goal ,every day.I'm know and I use the all basic Machine Learning algorithms but I prefer neural network throughout Language processing and Image Processing.Each work is a challenge for me and I want to do better every time.AI like we know today will change and I want to someone who can take the responsibility to lead this generation.
